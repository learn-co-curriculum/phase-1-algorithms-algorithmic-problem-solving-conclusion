# Algorithmic Problem Solving Conclusion

Congrats on getting through this section! You've learned some extremely valuable skills in terms of being able to tackle challenging problems and identify what good code looks like. You're well on your way to mastering your first algorithm interview! To recap, we covered:

- Define what "algorithm" means
- Develop a process for algorithmic problem solving
- Understand the usefulness of Big O notation
- Identify the Big O time and space complexity of a given algorithm
- Recognize common Big O runtimes: constant, logarithmic, linear, and quadratic

## Where We're Going From Here

We'll revisit algorithms formally once again in Phase 4, where we'll cover
another fundamental topic to help prepare for technical interviews: **data
structures**. In the meantime, it's important that you continue practicing what
you learned in this section and in particular, continue refining your problem
solving process.

From now until we return to algorithms in Phase 4, your main priority should be
learning the required material from each upcoming Phase and mastering the
practical skills you'll need to become a software engineer. When you're working
on labs, keep in mind what you learned in this section!

However, if you're able to make the time, it's also a great idea to dedicate
a little time each day (say 30 to 60 minutes) to continuing with your algorithm
studies.

Here are some resources to help:

### Flatiron Data Structures and Algorithms Canvas Course

Make sure to check out the Data Structures and Algorithms course on Canvas. Ask
your instructor for access if you don't already have it. This course was
designed to give students short problems to work on throughout their time at
Flatiron. There's also a version of this course you'll get access to upon
graduation, so don't worry if you aren't able to complete everything during the
program.

Our recommendation is to work on the following sections between now and Phase 4:

- Week 1: Starter Algorithms
- Week 2: Recursion
- Week 3: Additional Practice
- Week 4: Big O Notation
- Week 5: Big O Continued

The material from Week 6 and onward gets into Data Structures, which we'll cover
in more depth in Phase 4.
